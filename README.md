Creating machine learning models to predict potential bugs based on historical data is a powerful approach to improving software quality and reliability. Here's a brief overview of how you can achieve this: 

Objective 

The goal is to develop machine learning models that can predict the likelihood of bugs in software modules by analyzing historical data and code metrics. 

Key Components 

Data Collection: 

Historical Data: Gather historical bug data from version control systems (e.g., Git) and bug tracking systems (e.g., Jira). 

Code Metrics: Collect metrics such as commit_id, no. of commits, lines of code (LOC), cyclomatic complexity, lines_added, lines_deleted, code_churn, and bug present 

 
Explanation of Model Generalization
How the Model Works

Training Phase:
The model learns patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable (bug_present) from the training data.
It uses these learned patterns to make predictions.

Prediction Phase:
For new data, the model applies the same learned patterns to predict the likelihood of bugs.
Features such as high cyclomatic complexity, high code churn, and specific ratios (complexity_per_loc) can indicate higher risk of bugs.
