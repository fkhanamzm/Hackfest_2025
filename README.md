Using machine learning models to predict potential bugs based on historical data 

Random Forest is a versatile machine learning model used to predict potential bugs based on historical data, it is a powerful approach for improving software quality and reliability 

Some key advantages of Random Forest are Feature Randomness and Robustness 

Objective :: 

The goal is to use machine learning model(Random Forest) to predict the likelihood of bugs in software modules by analyzing historical data and code metrics.  

Key Components :: 

Data Collection :-  

Gather historical bug data from version control systems (e.g., Git) and bug tracking systems (e.g., Jira).  

Collect code metrics such as commit_id, no. of commits, lines of code (LOC), cyclomatic complexity, lines_added, lines_deleted, code_churn, and bug present  

Data Preprocessing :-  

Cleaning 

Normalization 

Feature Selection 

 

Model Training :- 

 

The model learns patterns and relationships between the features and the target variable (bug_present) from the training data 

It uses these learned patterns to make predictions. 

Prediction Phase :-  

For new data, the model applies the same learned patterns to predict the likelihood of bugs 

Features such as high cyclomatic complexity, high code churn, and specific ratios (complexity_per_loc) can indicate higher risk of bugs.
